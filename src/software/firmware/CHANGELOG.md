- improve pressure control
- fix a regression
  (_the PPeak+ button was not functioning anymore_)

## v1.5.2

## v1.5.1

- calibrate pressure sensor's offset on startup

- minor improvement to the pressure control

## v1.5.0

- rework pressure and blower control
  (_blower will now take more time to ramp up/down but this will greatly improve the stability of injected air volume in many scenario_)
- rework alarms

- disable alarms related to the breathing cycle when program is stopped
- fix an issue with a battery alarm being briefly triggered at every boot
- integration test: open both valves at startup

## v1.3.0

- add a program to test integration
